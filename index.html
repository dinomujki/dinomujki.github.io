		<p>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Modern life is full of frustrations, deadlines, and demands. For many people, stress is so commonplace that it has become a way of life. Stress is your body's way of responding to any kind of demand or threat. When you feel threatened, your nervous system responds by releasing a flood of stress hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol, which rouse the body for emergency action. Your heart pounds faster, muscles tighten, blood pressure rises, breath quickens, and your senses become sharper.
			<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The body's autonomic nervous system often does a poor job of distinguishing between daily stressors and life-threatening events. If you're stressed over an argument with a friend, a traffic jam on your commute to work, or a mountain of bills, for example, your body can still react as if you're facing a life-or-death situation.
			<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Stress that continues without relief can lead to a condition called distress -- a negative stress reaction. Distress can lead to physical symptoms including headaches, upset stomach, elevated blood pressure, chest pain, and problems sleeping. Research suggests that stress also can bring on or worsen certain symptoms or diseases.
			<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Stress also becomes harmful when people use alcohol, tobacco, or drugs to try to relieve their stress. Unfortunately, instead of relieving the stress and returning the body to a relaxed state, these substances tend to keep the body in a stressed state and cause more problems.

		<p>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Laughter triggers the release of a cocktail of happy chemicals that boosts the immune responses, particularly components related to anti-viral and anti-tumor defenses. This cocktail includes NK cells, endorphins, serotonin, growth hormone, interferon-gamma (IFN) and a host of other beneficial substances produced naturally every time we laugh heartily for extended periods.
			<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Laughter diminishes the secretion of cortisol and epinephrine, while enhancing immune reactivity. Laughter boosts secretion of growth hormone, an enhancer of key immune responses.
			<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Laughing leads to the release of endorphins, a self-manufactured natural opiate that has been scientifically shown to carry messages of attachment and bonding (the scientific terms for love), and to stimulate feelings of caring and forgiveness in addition to acting as a natural painkiller. Endorphins create a positive state of mind and boost optimism, self-confidence and feelings of self-worth.
			<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp By enhancing the free flow of emotions, laughter can help dislodge blocked emotions stored in the body. Suppressed or blocked emotions can cause ongoing physical, mental and emotional problems and stress. Their release can be life-changing. Laughter provides an excellent non-violent method for emotional release and catharsis.
			<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Laughter stimulates circulation and aids muscle relaxation, both of which help reduce some of the physical symptoms of stress.
			Expect to be far less tense and anxious after a Laughter Wellness or Laughter Yoga session! By increasing endorphins (hormones which assuage the sympathetic nervous system) laughter facilitates a state of peace in the body.
			<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Laughter is a natural antidote to many of the illness-causing effects of stress.
